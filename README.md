Momentum is an analogue of the Chrome Web Store application of the same name. The application shows the time and username. The background image and greeting changes depending on the time of day.

The application has a clock, an image slider, weather widgets, an audio player, a quote of the day block, settings and ToDoList. Local storage is used to store the username and location. In the settings you can choose one of the suggested languages, as well as hide those elements that you do not need (everything is store in the local storage)
